How to access the John Hopkins University Covid-19 Data
=======================================================

.. introduction::

   As the Covid-19 pandemic has swept the globe the work of `JHU (John Hopkins University) and their Covid-19 dashboard <https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html>`__ has become vitally important in keeping people informed about the progress of the virus in their communities, in their countries, and in the world in general.

   JHU not only publishes their dashboard, but `they make the data powering it freely available for anyone to use <https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>`__. However, this data is not in a format that is easy to consume. At MongoDB, we've been working with this data since it was first published while developing our :doc:`Charts dashboard </article/coronavirus-map-live-data-tracker-charts>`. Now we're making `our more accessible version of the JHU data <https://github.com/mongodb-developer/open-data-covid-19>`__ freely available for anyone to use.

   We have not modified the data in any way. What we have done is structured it better and made it easier to query by placing it within a `MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__ cluster and by creating some convenient APIs.

.. content::

   Where do we get the data?
   -------------------------

   All data is from `JHU <https://www.jhu.edu/>`__, they source their data from

   - the World Health Organization,
   - the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China,
   - the United States Centre for Disease Control,
   - the Australia Government Department of Health,
   - the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,
   - and many others.

   You can read the `full list on their GitHub repository <https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19>`__.

   The MongoDB Dataset
   -------------------

   We produced two different databases in our cluster.

   - ``covid19jhu`` contains the raw CSV files imported with the ``mongoimport`` tool,
   - ``covid19`` contains the same dataset but with a clean MongoDB schema design with all the good practices we are recommending.

   Here is an example of a document in the ``covid19`` database:

   .. code-block:: javascript

      {
        "_id" : ObjectId("5e957bfcbd78b2f11ba349bf"),
        "uid" : 312,
        "country_iso2" : "GP",
        "country_iso3" : "GLP",
        "country_code" : 312,
        "state" : "Guadeloupe",
        "country" : "France",
        "combined_name" : "Guadeloupe, France",
        "population" : 400127,
        "loc" : {
          "type" : "Point",
          "coordinates" : [ -61.551, 16.265 ]
        },
        "date" : ISODate("2020-04-13T00:00:00Z"),
        "confirmed" : 143,
        "deaths" : 8,
        "recovered" : 67
      }

   The document above was obtained by joining together the file ``UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table.csv`` and the CSV files time series you can find in `this folder <https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series>`__.

   Some fields might not exist in all the documents because they are not relevant or are just not provided by `JHU <https://www.jhu.edu/>`__. If you want more details, run a schema analysis with `MongoDB Compass <https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass>`__ on the `covid19.statistics` collection.

   If you would prefer to host the data yourself, the scripts required to download and transform the JHU data are open-source. You can `view them and instructions for how to use them on our GitHub repository <https://github.com/mongodb-developer/open-data-covid-19/tree/master/data-import>`__.

   Get Started
   -----------

   You can begin exploring the data right away without any MongoDB or programming experience using `MongoDB Charts <https://www.mongodb.com/products/charts>`__ or `MongoDB Compass <https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass>`__.

   With `Charts <https://www.mongodb.com/products/charts>`__, you can create visualisations of the data using any of the pre-built graphs and charts. You can then `arrange this into a unique dashboard <https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-coronavirus-lwlvn/public/dashboards/5e7a3667-c25a-4c3c-8ba2-5f5d6910e339>`__, or embed the charts in your pages or blogs.

   .. charts::
      :url: https://charts.mongodb.com/charts-coronavirus-lwlvn
      :id: 28dc1e9e-27a5-4259-ad5b-0f2b1bc9ff5e
      :autorefresh: 3600
      :theme: light

   .. blockquote::

      If you want to create your own MongoDB Charts dashboard, you will need to setup your own `Free MongoDB Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas>`__ cluster and import the dataset in your cluster using the `import scripts <https://github.com/mongodb-developer/open-data-covid-19/tree/master/data-import>`__.


   `Compass <https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass>`__ allows you to dig deeper into the data using the `MongoDB Query Language <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/>`__ or via the `Aggregation Pipeline <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/aggregation-pipeline/>`__ visual editor. Perform a range of operations on the data, `including mathematical, comparison and groupings <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/meta/aggregation-quick-reference/#operator-expressions>`__. Create documents which provide unique insights and interpretations. You can use the output from your pipelines as `data-sources for your Charts <https://docs.mongodb.com/charts/saas/data-sources/>`__.

   .. image:: /images/compass-covid19-screencast.gif
      :alt: Screencast showing some of the features of MongoDB Compass for exploring Covid-19 Data

   Because we store the data in MongoDB, you can also access it via the `MongoDB Shell <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/mongo/>`__ or using `any of our drivers <https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/>`__. We've limited access to these collections to 'read-only'. You can find the connection strings for the shell and Compass below, as well as driver examples for for `Java <https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/java/>`__, `Node.js <https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/>`__, and `Python <https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/python/>`__ to get you started.

   .. code-block:: shell

      mongo "mongodb+srv://covid-19.hip2i.mongodb.net/test"  --username readonly --password readonly

   For MongoDB Compass or your driver, you can use this connection string.

   .. code-block::

      mongodb+srv://readonly:readonly@covid-19.hip2i.mongodb.net/test

   In the following sections, we will show you how to consume this dataset using the Java, Node.js and Python drivers.

   We will show you how to perform the following queries in each language:

   - Retrieve the last 5 days of data for a given place,
   - Retrieve all the data for the last day,
   - Make a geo spatial query to retrieve data within a certain distance of a given place.

   Accessing the Data with Java

   Accessing the Data with Business Intelligence Tools
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You can get lots of value from the dataset without any programming at all.
   We've enabled the `Atlas BI Connector <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/bi-connection/>`__, which exposes an SQL interface to MongoDB's document structure.
   This means you can use data analysis and dashboarding tools like `Tableau <https://www.tableau.com/support/releases/desktop/10.3>`__,
   `Qlik Sense <https://www.qlik.com/us/products/qlik-sense>`__,
   and even `MySQL Workbench <https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/>`__ to analyze, visualise and extract understanding from the data.

   Here's an example of a visualisation produced in a few clicks with Tableau:

   .. image:: images/map-tableau.png
      :alt: Covid-19 World map in Tableau.

   Tableau is a powerful data visualisation and dashboard tool, and can be connected to our COVID-19 data in a few steps.
   We've written a `short tutorial <https://github.com/mongodb-developer/open-data-covid-19/blob/master/tableau/README.md>`__ to get you up and running.

   Accessing the Data with any SQL tool
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   As mentioned above, the `Atlas BI Connector <https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/bi-connection/>`__ is activated so you can connect any SQL tool to this cluster using the following connection information:

   - Server: covid-19-biconnector.hip2i.mongodb.net,
   - Port: 27015,
   - Database: covid19 or covid19jhu (depends which version of the dataset you want to see),
   - Username: readonly or readonly?source=admin,
   - Password: readonly.

.. summary::

   Wrap up
   -------

   We see the value and importance of making this data as readily available to everyone as possible, so we're not stopping here. Over the coming days, we'll be adding a GraphQL and REST API, as well as making the data available within Excel and Google Sheets.

   We've also launched an `Atlas credits program <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/helping-developers-tackle-covid19>`__ for anyone working on detecting, understanding, and stopping the spread of COVID-19.

   If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like any assistance working with the data, we're always available on the `community forums <https://community.mongodb.com/>`__. You can also reach out to `Aaron <https://twitter.com/aaronbassett>`__, `Joe <https://twitter.com/JoeKarlsson1>`__, `Mark <https://twitter.com/judy2k>`__, and `Maxime <https://twitter.com/MBeugnet>`__ directly on Twitter.
